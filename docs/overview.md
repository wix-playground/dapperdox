# Overview

## What is DapperDox?

DapperDox is an Open-Source API documentation generator and server for OpenAPI Swagger specifications.

It differs from other specification inspection tools in that it seamlessly combines your specifications
with documentation, guides and diagrams, all of which can be authored in Github Flavoured Markdown.

This enables you to produce rich, browsable reference websites for your APIs.
